# simplifyit

A collection of packages which are supposed to simplify a lot of R basic statistics for upcoming data scientists and analysts and are supposed to work together. The inspiration of this framework is from watching numerous fellow data analysts struggle with a point and click interface in R when they were migrating from any other application to R.

## Getting Started

Placeholder for future notes.

### Prerequisites

RStudio and some patience regarding learning the new language.

### Installing

Placeholder for instructions once the packages are released

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Built With

* [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) - A high-performance version of base R's data.frame
* [purrr](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr) - purrr enhances Râ€™s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors
* [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) - dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges
* [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) - The purpose of the future package is to provide a very simple and uniform way of evaluating R expressions asynchronously using various resources available to the user
 

## Unit testing

Most of the unit functions in this universe of packages will be part of tested using [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat)
